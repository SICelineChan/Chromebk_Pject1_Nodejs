# Chromebk_Project1_Nodejs
This page will also act as my mini diary and progress of this project.

So I have made a little note about what happened since this mini project kicked off around mid-Jan! Now coming to mid-Feb, a little update on how this is going. I'm super chuffed that I managed to see my REST APIs on MongoDB and mySQL. It was pretty soul-sucking just waiting for linux to download and to run dBeaver, after 2 hours, I managed a little mySQL database on my local chromebook. And after another few days of trying, I was able to get and post http request on RESTED to mySQL. Once more after a few more try, I wanna try deployment! I'm sure there is some security issues with mySQL, so I decided to comment my codes related mySQL and solely go for the MongoDB data first. As I said, 30mins or so later...

------------------
This is a project which I am using a chromebook instead of my trusty dell chonky laptop to revise node.js, using more backend programs, such as Mongo DB and My SQL. So far, as I'm travelling in Peru, the wifi is unfortunately not good get a good connection. So I'm sticking with local JSON until I can get to a more reliable connection.
