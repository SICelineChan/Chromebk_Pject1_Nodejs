# Chromebk_Project1_Nodejs
This page will also act as my mini diary and progress of this project.
This is a project which I am using a chromebook instead of my trusty dell chonky laptop to revise node.js, using more backend programs, such as Mongo DB and My SQL. So far, as I'm travelling in Peru, the wifi is unfortunately not good get a good connection. So I'm sticking with local JSON until I can get to a more reliable connection.
