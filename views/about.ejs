    <H1>About Me</H1>
    <h4>Hi, I'm Celine!</h4>
    <div class="container">
    <p>This new project is a working project using a chromebook with Linux Debian 11 as the developer system. I have never used Linux and my chunky Windows laptop is currently sitting at home, whilst I'm travelling. Since graduated from Hamburg Coding School in Dec 2022, I want to learn more on Node.js,MySql and MongoDB on my own. I'm trying to recreate my travel blog project for the 3rd time! Which "eventually" will have my working REST API and a "Login" page.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm also using Bootstrap, so there will be some more CSS added to this site here and there!</p>
    <br>
    <p>It was actually quite easy to use React.js to create my travel blog using Mapbox and deploy it on Netlify. So this will be the aim of this personal project!</p>
